Crowdfund is a simple web page that displays products that users can pledge for or just pledge to support the project. This project is based on the [crowdfunding-product-page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/crowdfunding-product-page-7uvcZe7ZR) challenge from Frontend Mentor. The final solution can be accessed at [crowdfund-products-page](https://crowdfund-products-page.netlify.app/).

## Why am I doing this challenge?

I personally feel like I struggle with not knowing what to build for a personal project, and if I do come up with an idea, it's a struggle to come up with the design for the application. I thought doing this challenge would be a fun way to actually apply some of the things that I have learned so far, see what weaknesses I have, and gain a basic sense of good UX/UI design from looking at the designs. Essentially, my goal was just to have fun, learn, and improve.

## Features

### Make Pledges!

The user can choose what type of pledge they want to make from a select list.

### Data Manipulation!

The page comes with initial data to simulate a real-world scenario, and when the user makes a pledge, it updates that data and lets the user see the changes.

## Things I can Improve on

- ### Organization

     While working on the project, I found that I need to come up with more effective names for variables and file names. Because a lot of the names were similar, I would find myself going to the wrong files or styling the wrong things.

- ### Styles

    I feel like I could better manage my stylesheet or start implementing utility classes so there is less dry code.

- ### Planning

    I actually felt like my planning was good in the beginning, but I made a critical mistake where when the user selects a pledge and a modal pops up, it displays the same pledges but you can add inputs. That was the correct behaviour but I forgot to consider that the the initial pledges were supposed to stay the same but instead they would change to the modal version so there would be 2 modal pledge containers at one time. I later need to change the structure of something and in this project it was not a big deal but it is a mistake that could have been avoided with better planning and observation.
